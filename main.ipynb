      "Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).\n",

      "My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!\n",

      "I opened the can and immediately became concerned when I saw what looked like dried white crust, rather than fluffy frosting.  The package recommended stirring before use, so I gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous goo.  The best I can equate it to is a white version of the blue goop the mother serves for dinner in \"Better of Dead\" (no raisins in it though!).<br />I tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous goo with white crusties in it.  When lifting the knife to spread it long strings on goo trailed from my knife.<br />I opted for making my own frosting instead - very easy!  A little Sprectrum palm shortening, a lot of powdered sugar, a tiny splash of vanilla, a tiny bit of salt, and rice milk as needed for consistency, beat for 5 minutes, and I had the fluffy 'butter' cream frosting I thought I'd get from Cherrybrook.<br /><br />I wonder if our can was overheated in the store (whole foods) or something...<br />I've read positive reviews of their frosting mix, so maybe I'll try that next time.\n",

      "Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!\n",

      "I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...\n",
